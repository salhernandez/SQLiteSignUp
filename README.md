# SQLiteSignUp
A simple Sign Up app that uses a SQLite Database to store usernames and Passwords

NOTE: In UsersDB there are many unused methods. The ones that are used are under the banner
USER METHODS. The rest are there for reference since they were in the original code that I based myself on.

I used [stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/), which allows the user to enable chrome developer options, by doing this I can see the current contents on the database.
However, the database can only be viewd if it is running off a rooted device or an emulated device (AVD).
